      "['Facts: http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/9/21/sexual-assault-climate-results/ As part of Title 9, 27 universities just did an enormous survey of the student population to which a majority of students responded. We are in the rare position of having current, large sample-size, hard numbers to offer. At Harvard among female seniors, 31% reported \"nonconsensual sexual contact\", and 16% reported they had \"experienced penetration or attempted penetration without their consent\" while at college. \\n\\nConclusions: Those numbers are appalling. At a minimum, they are high enough to make clear that the problem is not limited to a small number of outlier creeps. 1/6 of female college seniors had to deal with someone trying to penetrate them without their consent. It is worth considering whether a big part of the problem is generally good people who once or twice in four years get carried away thinking a non-consensual situation is normal, acceptable, or signals consent (because of their ideas and expectations about appropriate behavior and gender roles).  The general term for that phenomenon is \"rape culture\" and the numbers seem to support that it is a real phenomenon. How was the survey performed? What percentage of the uni participated? What was the demographic of the students who did participate? Updated to include a source. It was administered anonymously online, response rate was over 50% of student body including grad schools, over 60% of female seniors. There is good reason to believe the results are valid/representative. I fail to see how this is representative of a rape culture. Attempted penatration was included in these numbers meaning no rape actually occred, just unwanted advances which were shut down. If 16% of women responded they were penatrated against their will then yes, such would be evidence of rape culture, but for all we know, 14% of those cases were attempts which were stopped by a \\'no\\' and only 2% of reported were actual penatrations. At best this is evidence of a sexual assult cultre.  So if you look at the source, penetration did occur to 13%. So only 3% of those cases were stopped. That\\'s huge. \\n\\n\"Sexual assault culture\", is that not still a huge, pervasive problem? The source had nothing to say about the 13% to 2% distinction so...?\\n\\n\\nNo one is arguing whether or not sexual assault is a problem. The argument is whether or not we live in a culture which encourages rape. We certainly live in a culture which encourages risky sexual practices, but just the fact these universities are taking place indicates our culture views rape as a problem and not something to be celebrated.  The chart at the top shows 13% completed penetration. The idea is with that level of prevalence it is not just \"bad people\" who are the perpetrators, it is ordinary people who act wrongly or treat a nonconsensual situation as acceptable that cause a lot of the incidents. Rape culture is a convenient shorthand for the attitudes and beliefs that lead to those kinds of incidents.  Ah, the wifi I\\'m on was blocking the pic. You\\'re right. Still dissagree as to this being evidence of rape culture.  You\\'re entitled to your opinion. I appreciate you acknowledging the numbers. When we have cases like the mattress girls, a very complicated case which arguably is a crying wolf scenario, it becomes very difficult to take these surveys at face value. What type of an affect does constantly talking about things such as rape culture have on these surveys? Wouldn\\'t there have to be a certain number which are stretches of the definition, or encounters which were as much convoluted communication as they were assault? Doesn\\'t the fact that you are trying so hard to disbelieve or discredit 13% of female seniors stating they were penetrated without consent (which was clearly defined in the survey and not open to misinterpretation) suggest the existence of rape culture? Based on no evidence other than one extreme case that gained national attention for being so controversial, and your *assumption* that large numbers of women at 27 colleges exaggerated or lied on the survey, you are trying to to argue that 13% of women reporting nonconsensual penetration is a language problem, not a rape/assault problem. That goes way, way beyond healthy or reasonable skepticism. &gt;Doesn\\'t the fact that you are trying so hard to disbelieve or discredit 13% of female seniors stating they were penetrated without consent (which was clearly defined in the survey and not open to misinterpretation) suggest the existence of rape culture? \\n\\nNot in the least, especially considering your next argument.\\n\\n\\n&gt;Based on no evidence other than one extreme case that gained national attention for being so controversial, and your *assumption* that large numbers of women at 27 colleges exaggerated or lied on the survey, you are trying to to argue that 13% of women reporting nonconsensual penetration is a language problem, not a rape/assault problem. That goes way, way beyond healthy or reasonable skepticism.\\n\\nIf there is one who exaggerated, there are two, where there are two there are theee. Why do we continually see false rape culture examples? UVA , Lena Dunham, mattress girl ect. Every high profile case in the past year has been shown to be false, hardly a one off occurance, and yet we\\'re supposed to pretend there\\'s a culture of rape? If anything popular culture over the past year has shown there is a culture of false rape accusations. \\n Do you not see how you reasoned through that? Based on *your personal sample* of individual headlines and prejudicial assumptions? (If anything, the national discussion of false allegations shows how rare they are; actual rape rarely makes national headlines. Also how heavily something is reported is no evidence of how much it occurs. Does the heavy reporting on plane crashes prove we\\'re experiencing more plane crashes?)\\n\\nThere is such thing as reasonable skepticism, but responding to hard numbers in an anonymous, large, and precisely-defined survey with increasingly tenuous assumptions about female dishonesty or over-sensitivity is unreasonable skepticism.\\n\\nMaybe consider the possibility that the vast majority of respondents are reasonable people who are reporting accurately? &gt;(If anything, the national discussion of false allegations shows how rare they are; actual rape rarely makes national headlines.)\\n\\nBecause there have been major false allegations ot shows how rare they are? How about; because there are false allegations it shows how rare rapes actually are.\\n\\n&gt;There is such thing as reasonable skepticism, but responding to hard numbers in an anonymous, large, and precisely-defined survey with increasingly tenuous assumptions about female dishonesty or over-sensitivity is unreasonable skepticism.\\n\\nAccording to the person arguing there is a rape culture maybe, but the burdon of proof lay on you and an **anonymous** suvey on liberal universities proves nothing. \\n\\n&gt;Maybe consider the possibility that the vast majority of respondents are reasonable people who are reporting accurately?\\n\\nMaybe consider those who answered the surveys are biased to respond in a way which would increase the number of cases. These individuals are after all told they are in a rape culture and respond as they are trained to.\\n\\nTo be fair, according to these surveys and affirmative consent Ive been raped a lot. ', 'When a man or a woman is raped, do we usually side with th victim or the accuser. What if the accuser is bright or beloved, like Kobe Bryant we seem to look the other way. That is all they mean. Another great example is any shuemer. She raped a guy, made a speech about it and was not seen as a rapist for having sex with a guy far over the legal limit while she was sober, she was seen as somehow inspiring. \\n\\nWith Cosby people are still lining up to see him. \\n\\nThe average rapist gets less than 10 years, most rapes go unsolved or unreported making rape one of the easiest crimes to get away with. \\n\\nI agree a lot of statistics are bullshit (no, 1/4 women on college campuses are not raped) but there are valid statistics and facts that would contribute to what could be called a rape culture.  &gt; In the last few years, there has been an unfortunate trend towards blaming “rape culture”\\nfor the extensive problem of sexual violence on campuses. While it is helpful to point out\\nthe systemic barriers to addressing the problem, it is important to not lose sight of a simple\\nfact: Rape is caused not by cultural factors but by the conscious decisions, of a small\\npercentage of the community, to commit a violent crime. \\n\\nhttps://rainn.org/images/03-2014/WH-Task-Force-RAINN-Recommendations.pdf Yes, but acceptance of that practice may encourage it. \\n\\nIf you knew you had a 90% chance of getting away with it, if caught you would aerve under 10 years and odds are your victim won\\'t come forward (and you had no remorse and were a bad person) that is what leads to a rape culture and more rapes. \\n\\nAlso that is one organization they don\\'t speak for every rape victim  As with all arguments for rape culture, let\\'s shift the crime to something less emotionally charged and see if it holds weight.\\n\\nIf there was a 90% chance you\\'d get away with it (source please, wikipedia says 8-12% of claims are unfounded) would you beat that coworker you don\\'t like so bad he ended up in the hospital?\\n\\nWhy not!  You\\'ll probably get away with it!\\n\\nPerhaps there is more to what makes a person rape than \"will I get away with it?\"\\n\\nIf a cop pulls you over and searches your car under suspicion that you\\'re trafficking drugs, but doesn\\'t find any... Is it more likely that he was mistaken/you weren\\'t trafficking drugs or that you got away with trafficking drugs?\\n\\nOnce upon a time, it was \"innocent until proven guilty\" but with rape accusations its either he\\'s found guilty or he got away with it.\\n\\nRAINN says you\\'re wrong.  They\\'re legit enough for me, why not for you? Most accusations are true, most people just never come forward, when you read victimization surveys way more people come forward about being raped than people reporting it. \\n\\nThe sense of I\\'ll get away gives rapists more power, rape is about power not sex. \\n\\nIt is still innocent until proven guilty under the law, but we aren\\'t discussing law we are discussing culture \\n\\n\\nRainn is one group, you sound like kind of an mra so I\\'ll use the example of circumcision, the CDC says it is beneficial is that not good enough?  &gt; Most accusations are true, most people just never come forward, when you read victimization surveys way more people come forward about being raped than people reporting it.\\n\\nThe only sources I\\'ve seen that bafk your claim up are those third party surveys that use non-legal, nebulous definitions of rape such as \"have you had sex while drunk\" and while I don\\'t feel like a rape victim, that question proves I\\'m dating a rapist.\\n\\nSame goes for that survey claiming half of men are rapists if you don\\'t call them rapists, asking \"have you ever used drugs or alcohol to get sex\" meaning any guy who bought a girl a drink at a bar is an attempted rapist.\\n\\nSo again.  What\\'s your source?\\n\\n&gt; It is still innocent until proven guilty under the law, but we aren\\'t discussing law we are discussing culture\\n\\nYou\\'ve said this on Reddit.  I\\'m assuming you don\\'t need the wall of text and links proving otherwise if I just point out your \"90% of rapists get away with it\" comment? http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com//news/canada/been-raped-never-reported-why-90-of-sex-assault-victims-stay-silent-rather-than-face-trial-by-ordeal\\n\\nhttp://www.surrey.ac.uk/mediacentre/press/2009/16532_between_7090_rapes_thought_to_go_unreported_and_94_of_reported_cases_dont_end_in_a_conviction.htm\\n\\nAnd is rainn good enough? \\n\\nhttps://rainn.org/news-room/97-of-every-100-rapists-receive-no-punishment', \"Historically minorities have been able to show their value to their nation and show their love for their nation by serving bravely and loyally in the armed forces. This allows them to show that they are contributing to the nation that they want to change. So it would hurt their causes if women and homosexuals were to abandon what is considered a noble and honorable pursuit. It would allow bigots to say if you won't fight for this country why should this country change rule x for you.Also the military offers a way of extreme economic and social mobility without the need for a college degree. Your able to prove yourself by the sweat of your brow. Also to say that the military is solely a tool of destruction is partially correct but the military is also used as a tool of good will for national disasters. Also the army Corp of engineers are in charge of maintaining a portion of the nation's wetlands. The army went and helped in Haiti, new Orleans, nepal, and many other natural disasters.\\n\\n\\nEdit \\nAlso the US military is the sole defender of women's rights in afghanistan. So they definitely defend that and other human rights like we defend minority groups while we were in Iraq and in afghanistan  i simply disagree with you about this. you will not be able to change my view by arguing that the military is good or that killing people is the kind of bravery and loyalty that is progressive. I think the opposite. it is vile and disgusting and proves that those in the military are mindless serial killers who are unable to decide for themselves whether murder is justified. Spent 8 years in the army been to Iraq and Afghanistan definitely not a mindless serial killer. You are sterotyping an organization that is made up of thousands of people. The army has about 1 percent of its force as fighters , about the same for the Marines, a super small amount for the navy and even smaller for the airforce. These groups have incredibly complex tasks that involve winning over foreign occupied people. Also the stereotypes of mindless follower is wrong when the reality of it is that you are expected to make drastic decisions in the absence of orders. Many of them have made the decision for them selves that killing in defence of their nations, and it's interests is justified. Their are others who want the college benefits offered by the military, the steady career, or a better lifestyle for themselves and their families. You have an overly simplistic view of the military and the men and women that make it work. It isn't meant to be a progressive force of the left it is meant to be the nation's strength and when minorities join it the legitimize their causes by saying they are willing to get their hands dirty for they country. Your view that no progressive should support war at any cost you'll have to think that a invasion could have prevented the genocide in rawanda and military intervention did halt the genocide in the balkans. your job, no matter what you say, is to make the military a more efficient of a mindless killer. even if you were just peeling potatoes. \\n\\nand i will never support the military, so please don't bother trying to make it sound better. just like i won't support isis.  So if in the process of killing isis would I not be protecting the human rights of the women being raped by isis, the gay men being executed, all of the people being persecuted and sold into slavery. Or is all the good that would come from killing one isis member would be negated by the act of taking a vicious oppressors life. Fighting off a regressive oppressive force is progress. Fighting people that commit horrible atrocities, that broadcast such atrocities across the Internet is progress. To not allow women and gays to take part in that because they would kill someone is not progress. That is supporting a horrible status quo in a misguided attempt as being a pacifist. The ss wasn't stopped by saying pretty please. The Japanese atrocities in mainland Asia weren't stopped by saying pretty please. The religious police of the taliban weren't stopped by saying pretty please. Isis won't be stopped by saying pretty please. Also killing a combatant in war is not murder it is killing because both people are willing participants. Killing a civilian is murder but exceptions are made for accidents. These exceptions also have very narrow guidelines so contrary to your belief that every service member wakes up and shoots a baby it just not true that they are all murders. Also you say equality at the cost of human rights is not progress were can you show evidence that the people that we are at war with lost human rights. \", \"The law is a grey area regarding sex under the influence. I believe it's illegal in Wisconsin and a few other states, but it's ultimately all about if the person could make an informed decision.
