Or are we now trying to force people to act in a way that\\'s counter to their natural (and harmless) sexual preferences?\\n\\nI think it\\'s extremely hypocritical for a trans person to say \"You have to accept my autonomy and personal choices because I\\'m a human and I\\'m not hurting one by exercising that autonomy\" but for them to then go \"I refuse to accept that you\\'re not sexually attracted to anyone but biological females with XX chromosomes, you have to change the way you live your life even though you\\'re a also human and you\\'re also not hurting anyone.\"\\n\\nMy sexual preference hurts *no one*. Even if someone says \"I don\\'t date black girls because I find them unattractive\", that\\'s not racist - it hurts nobody. That\\'s having a sexual preference. Saying \"I\\'m not attracted to black girls because they\\'re lazy\" or \"I\\'m not attracted to black girls because they smell\", *that\\'s* racist because it plays into racial stereotypes. Simply not being attractive to certain features that are predominately exhibited by certain a race isn\\'t racist, it\\'s just nature. If someone is *only* attracted to pale skin, naturally they\\'re not going to be attracted to people with anything but pale skin. Meaning, they\\'re not going to be attracted to tan white girls the same way they won\\'t be attracted to black girls. It\\'s not racist, it\\'s just nature - and it\\'s wrong to force someone to feel sexual attraction for a group of people they have no natural sexual attraction to.\\n\\nIt\\'s when the lack of attraction is rooted in bigoted, prejudicial conceptions that it becomes a problem. It\\'s not prejudicial to say \"I\\'m not attracted to trans people because I\\'m not attracted to people with Y chromosomes\". It\\'s prejudicial to say \"I\\'m not attracted to trans people because they\\'re weirdo sexual deviants.\" \\n\\nBut to say I\\'m a bigot because I refuse to date anyone who has a Y chromosome only serves to alienate me against the LGBT cause. I\\'m 100% in favor of LGBT rights and think they deserve all the rights and freedoms every other American deserves. But as soon as they start showing a refusal to try to understand *my* lifestyle and *my* personal choices, well that\\'s when I stop trying to understand their lifestyle and their personal choices.
