Right? It also shows that potential employers prefer the black names Leroy and Jermain at nearly 60% higher rates than the names Todd and Neal. Why do employers hate Todd\\'s and Neal\\'s so much? \\n\\nIf the deciding factor of calling back a potential employee was their name, white and black names would have a much smaller variance for their callback rates.

      "['Your experience with menial jobs being staffed by black people doesn\\'t really necessarily mean much. There\\'s a whole lot of places on the East coast with majority black populations -- of course you\\'re going to find black people working shit jobs. There are shit jobs everywhere.\\n\\nThis is part of the reason why I agree with /u/ApeTit4TwoHundred. In the U.S. you can go all around the country and find whites (even when they\\'re in the majority of the population of the city or town) in the same socioeconomic position. However, there is no question that by percentage black people face poverty more often than other subgroups.\\n\\nWhile it\\'s true that any problem that happens in the United States is by definition \"America\\'s problem,\" there are many places that have no \"race problem\" -- at least in the way places like Ferguson do. And these incidents that the OP spoke of, \"racial tension\" (aka riots) are not \"common\" throughout the country in the same way it was common during the civil rights movement. Think about how common stuff like the Freedom Riders and the Birmingham Campaign and all of the violence surrounding them was and how rare it is now. The \"incidents of racial tension\" then were pointing to and were part of the solution to America\\'s \"race problem\" *then*. But the problem now is...different, and framing the problem in a certain way might get us the wrong solution.\\n\\nHere\\'s Mississippi\\'s poverty stats.\\n\\n&gt;24.1% in poverty\\n\\n&gt;Number of people in poverty: 721,573\\n\\n&gt;% of race in poverty &amp; raw estimated number\\n\\n&gt;37% black = 412,846\\n\\n&gt;28% asian = 9,116\\n\\n&gt;35% latino = 28,518\\n\\n&gt;18.6% native american = 4,819\\n\\n&gt;12.8% white = 266,274\\n\\nIf you\\'re interested, you can actually see the poverty rates broken down by race for every state here -- even in Montana there\\'s a disparity between white and black poverty despite being the whitest state in the USA: http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/publications/Appendix_Tables1-24.pdf \\n\\nBlacks at 25-35%, whites at 10-18%, in general, per state.\\n\\nWhy bring all this up when it all seems to point that the fact that the U.S. has a race problem? Because when I think \"racial tension\" I think civil rights and government. If only the problem were as easy as changing the laws (and I do think some laws, like drug law, disproportionately affects black communities.) A lot of Chinese I know like to say there\\'s \"no racism in China\" which I think is very similar to what one of Iran\\'s leaders said, \"we don\\'t have any gays in Iran.\" You could accuse me of saying something similar here. Which is to say you could say I\\'m just using a different way of defining \"racial tension\" that misdirects you from an issue. For example, China\\'s being xenophobic and ignorant toward other cultures/races (not to mention that for all intents and purposes China is like 90% Han Chinese and nearly 99.9% Chinese overall, and their history of cultural domination, Tibet, etc.); or Iran\\'s execution of some gays and that their gays are actually just incredibly in the closet as a result; or the United States\\'s problem at the intersection of [poverty and race [1]](http://federalsafetynet.com/uploads/2/8/4/4/2844290/1442587447.jpg). [[2]](http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-statistics.html).\\n\\nBut I\\'m not doing that. Or, I\\'m not doing it intentionally. I think that labeling it as \"a race problem\" is perhaps not only incorrect, but it tends to make people reach into the \"civil rights law toolbox.\" A toolbox which I don\\'t think contains the remedy we need.\\n\\nThe problem is culture. This means white american culture, black american culture, and the general overculture of the United States that binds us together as a country -- the values and attitudes we all hold, black or white, that make us American despite our differences. I can\\'t tell you what this solution is but we\\'ve made great and relatively exceptional pace towards that goal. My hunch is that until we hit a post-scarcity civilization we\\'re going to be dealing with this \"race problem.\" \\n\\nWhat this means, unfortunately I think, is related to stats like how in Mississipi only 18% of businesses are owned by blacks despite the state being 37% black in terms of population. The question is, do you want a country that mandates by law that if X% of the population is Y (Race, sex, age, intelligence) then X% of businesses must be owned by Y? I don\\'t. And America is very much not that country. It could change, yes, but it\\'s an unrealistic hope even in the long term.\\n\\nThis means we go about it by attacking symptoms. We provide things like basic income. We provide things like SNAP. And most importantly of all we provide education. *To everyone.* But all of that is meaningless unless there is a movement within the black community to (and I rightly dislike this idiom) pull oneself up by one\\'s bootstraps. But it seems to me that it\\'s an accurate summation of the situation. The phrase points to an extreme difficulty, if not outright impossibility to the point of it being almost ridiculous. [Crab mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality), victim mentality, anti-intellectualism. All three seem to be deeply suffused into black culture, and perhaps even rightly so. After all, historically they were victims of slavery, forced sterilization, etc. It\\'s not surprising. \\n\\nBut imagine you\\'re a black kid who grows up in poverty. You grow up learning that you have no chance, that the system is out to get you, that had you been born not more than near 150 years ago and you\\'d be a slave or 50 years ago and you wouldn\\'t be able to vote. You learn this from personal experience and you learn it from your friends and family and school. Then your role models are engaged in crime and general non-conforming ways of making a living because stealing from the people fucking you doesn\\'t seem all that bad in your moral calculation (who doesn\\'t think Aladdin was justified in stealing the bread?). So you grow to be just like them. Cycle of poverty. Cycle of crime.\\n\\nHow to stop it? As leaders or as citizens, how do we stop it? The answer I propose is *we can\\'t.* Despite what we believe, namely that we\\'re all one species and we all have equal right to live and be happy, if you and me go there and try to make change we\\'ll be rejected and even if we aren\\'t we wont be the solution. Black kids need black role models. They need someone to look up to with reasonable and attainable goals. The black community needs to save itself. It must assert itself.\\n\\nThis isn\\'t the happy solution. And it might even strengthen the racial divides -- the ones that seem to organically appear as people \"ghettoize\" themselves or are ghettoized by things like \"white flight.\" But good fucking luck telling that black kid in urban poverty that he should look up to a successful white businessman or successful white scientist, and that it shouldn\\'t matter that he\\'s white and not black. \\'aint gonna work. Interestingly, this is what affirmative action is supposed to be -- a way for government to intervene and try to change society to repair the historical disadvantage. In 2003 Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O\\'Conner said, \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\" We\\'re 13 years away from that day. I hope she\\'s right, but I really doubt it. Both because affirmative action\\'s (race-based government intervention to change culture/society) effectiveness is in much dispute, and because I think these problems stem from our tribalistic nature.\\n\\n//shit no one will ever read'\n",
      " \"I think this view is very typical of those on the outside looking in. For some reason people will believe that only overt racism is racism, which in this would be your view that racial tension equals that which can be solved by civil rights legislation, which is only the tip of the ice berg when it comes to racism. This totally ignores the subtle and insidious racism that permeates American culture. \\n\\nThe second tactic is to divorce race from the conversation by labeling this a class issue. The problem is that historically race has been what drives class. They were poor because they are black. I've always found it interesting that people will willingly concede that that blacks are disproportionately more likely to be poor,  but then at the same time believe it isn't a race issue. That is some serious cognitive dissonance.  Just to make a extreme analogy to drive my point home,  it would be like if I said Jews were disproportionately more likely to be killed by nazis, but the jews weren't killed because of their ethnicity/religion. Have you ever asked yourself why blacks are disproportionately  more likely to be poor? Have you ever asked yourself why blacks weren't able to pass down wealth at the rates whites were? It's not like blacks had no idea what assets or inheritance were.  Basically all of this leads all leads to somewhere.  If we go back to my Jewish analogy there was a glaring question left unanswered. Maybe there are other reasons for the phenomenon that isn't racism. That's the way this argument is set up. I dont even have to read your full post to know you spoke about culture, and bonus points if you used the phrase boot straps. I know this without reading because this argument is fairly common among racists and non racists alike.  This isn't a white thing either,  as you will find people of all races including black people make this argument.  The common dominator here is lack of a quality education about blacks in America,  which isn't uncommon due to the fact that we only teach it one month a year and we barely cover anything outside of mlk and the naacp. Because of this people will make the bootstraps argument without realizing the long history of blacks trying to do that very thing. From 40 acres and a mule, to w.e.b. Dubois, to George Washington carver, to black wall street, to Marcus Garvey, to the nation of islam, and to the nation of islam. All of these people/groups/programs we're about securing assets and creating self sustaining African American communities, and all of them were assassinated, discredited, and in the case of 40 acres and a mule, an outright lie. So many times throughout history, blacks have tried to sustain them selves and white America responded with incredulity, smear campaigns, the rope, and the gun. So the cultural argument is not only tone deaf, but one that is almost entirely based on ignorance. It's respectability politics in its worst form.  \\n\\nThere are other problems with this argument that I don't want to get into too much. The first is that we never examine the fact that we live in a culture that promotes white supremacy,  and is permeated with racist beliefs, colloquial phrases,  and stereotypes. It's also interesting that few people ever examine how black culture came to be what it is.  It's almost like they believe it came about totally in a vacuum with no outside influence.

You did it numerous times throughout your post. \\n\\n&gt;You might not have read my post very carefully because it\\'s specifically talking ONLY about so called \"hidden racism\" rather than overt violence. \\n\\nI was responding to your comment about how you think racial tension is only that which could be solved by civil rights legislation.\\n\\n&gt;The whole point of my post was that the kinds of problems we are facing regarding \"race\" cannot be ethically solved with punitive law enforced by government because the root of the evil is in human nature\\'s tribalism.\\n\\nThis is a cop out. First of all no one has ever really proven that tribalism is why people are racist. Considering the amount of people who are able to not be racist or xenophobic, it is much more likely that racism is due to ignorance of other groups, which can absolutely be \"solved.\"\\n\\n&gt;given what I said in my post. I mean I literally have a sentence that says \"After all, historically they were victims of slavery, forced sterilization, etc. It\\'s not surprising.\"\\n\\nI asked this question because you gave that statement lip service, and then proceeded to dive into the culture argument. So if you agree that blacks faced this discrimination then what is the point of making the culture argument? You can change the culture but if the discrimination is still present then you arnt going to make much of the difference. This is where we really get to the meat of my argument which you have ignored. That is that black people have been trying to do what you claim we should do for centuries. That is why your argument is tone deaf, and thats why I said you were ignorant of black history. Because some who isnt ignorant of said history would know the numerous examples of blacks attempting to achieve self reliance and getting shit on for it. I noticed you have still failed to address that but whatever. \\n\\n&gt;Actually, I\\'m saddened incredibly by your post. What an absolute shame. You claim to be a kind of vanguard against ignorance and then do the thing most associated with the ignorant.\\n\\nI never claimed to be a vanguard against anything. I just pointed out the flaws in your played out bootstrap argument. If that saddens you then too bad I guess. Im still laughing at the fact that I didnt even have to read your whole post to know you said it either. Thats how played out this argument is. \\n\\n&gt;In a way, your un-nuanced and I guess technically ironic view is emblematic of the reason why we\\'re always going to have to deal with the consequences of our in-born tribalism.\\n\\nNothing about my argument was tribalistic. It was pointing out how out of touch you are when you assume black people dont know and havnt known that we need to work hard and help ourselves. Our whole history in this country has been dominated by blacks trying to position themselves to work hard and help themselves, and every time we were smacked right the fuck back down into the shitty neighborhoods we were herded into. So excuse me if the bootstraps argument falls on deaf ears. It\\'s because you arnt telling anyone anything that they dont already know. '\n",

You do not have the time to give a shit about every individual that stops breathing and never starts again. You certainly can care about things that cause death, like disease or war, and do things to prevent those from taking so many lives. But you, as an individual, cannot take every individual death as a major event. \\n\\nNow, you can become informed or already aware of and care for someone who dies. Almost every person that dies has people who care, deeply. I'm not arguing that point. I'm saying that as a country, we cannot treat events that happen regularly as special. By their definition, special events are extraordinary. Meaning outside of ordinary. If something becomes ordinary, like someone dying, that is not special or major, relative to an entire nation. If that person happens to be someone you think of as a mother, then yes that would be a unique and not ordinary event.

But I don't exactly get offered oysters so again, it's not something I have to consider! \\n\\nI don't think I'd eat insects, probably because I don't need to and I don't know if they feel pain but I wouldn't feel okay about eating them just for fun, you know? \\n\\nDoes that make sense?

Or skin it and use the skin to make something useful?\\n\\nYou can probably tell I haven't had the opportunity to ask vegans anything before, but you've probably been asked these questions too many times, so it's ok if you want to decline :)\"\n",

Now the adopted child will suffer from the psychological harm you point out in your OP. We don't know how to monetize it, but we can answer the question, how bad would it have to be for the child to prefer staying in China. As long as the psychological harm from being adopted is worth less than 38,200 dollars a year the child would prefer being adopted.

For example, they may be convinced that a barely visible scar is a major flaw that everyone is staring at, or that their nose looks abnormal.\\n\\nAn anorexic person is someone who believes they are fat.

A transgender woman who is pre-hormones looks in the mirror and sees a fuckin' man just like you do. That's the entire problem. The entire problem is that she's seeing what's actually there. Furthermore if an anorexic person loses weight they continue to think they are fat. If a transgender person starts hormones... after a while they no longer fixate as much on their appearance. These are two completely different issues that are literally moving in opposite directions.\\n\\nFinally, there is a reason that traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and treatment through anti-psychotics/anti-depressents works for anorexia and does not work for gender dysphoria *at all*, and that's because anorexia is a software issue and gender dysphoria is a hardware issue. Gender dysphoria is a matter of hard-wired orientation. It's no more fixable than homosexuality.\\n\\nWhile it's common for individuals in the trans community to become body dysmorphic over features that they perceive as making them look like the wrong sex (such as a transgender woman becoming obsessed with the size of her forehead even after facial feminization surgery), transgender people typically do not continue to struggle with their bodies after they've fixed their bodies enough to be passable members of the sex they are trying to live as.

Your claim that it is indisputably a mental disorder is false. If you look at the opinions of experts who actually study transgender health, almost none of them consider it to be a mental disorder. The claim that being transgender is a mental disorder is psuedoscience.\\n\\nFrom the APA:\\n\\n&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with\\xa0anxiety,\\xa0depression\\xa0or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.\\n\\n&gt;According to the\\xa0Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria.\" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care.

      " 'You\\'re very uninformed about the 1st amendment law as it pertains to free speech.\\n\\n&gt;No, the performance of your duties as an employee is not considered an exercise in your free speech just because it involves talking.\\n\\nFirst, you need to orient yourself in the correct model of analysis, which is analyzing a government law and to whom it applies.  The government is NOT more empowered to restrict your speech when you\\'re at a place of employment than anywhere else MERELY by virtue of you being at a place of employment.  Maybe you\\'re confusing and conflating the entities of the government and the employer.  The employer can put in place whatever rules he wants with respect to speech, because you\\'re free to leave that place of employment if you don\\'t want to obey that rule.  But that doesn\\'t implicate first amendment issues AT ALL.  Government restrictions are another matter entirely.\\n\\nYou should also educate yourself on the types of restrictions and the thresholds of those restrictions that SCOTUS permits with respect to speech.  Content neutral restrictions, for example, are given more leeway by the courts than content specific restrictions.  For example, if the government were to put out a law that said: no speech can be permitted from 5:00 pm onwards, such a law is content neutral and will be given more deference by the courts, but a law that says: no speech in praise of the movie \"Dunkirk\" is allowed from 5:00 pm onwards, that law would be given the strictest scrutiny by the courts and are almost always struck down as unconstitutional, because it is essentially the government promoting one point of view over another.\\n\\nSimilarly, if the government is forcing you to call someone by a specific pronoun over another pronoun, that is content specific restriction would almost certainly be struck down for the same reason - the government promoting one view over another.\\n\\n&gt;While the free exercise of both free speech and religion are protected from government restriction, only in the case of religion is the government also prohibited forcing you to engage in it (i.e., respecting the establishment of).\\n\\nAlso, not accurate.  There is no real distinction from forcing you to engage in something versus restricting you from doing something.  Any action can be framed either way merely using semantics.  For example, is a law forcing you to save someone drowning in a river an affirmative force or a restriction?  That seems to be an affirmative act, but you can easily rephrase the law to say: you must not allow anyone to drown in a river if it is reasonably within your power to save them.  Now, it is a restriction.\\n\\nIn the realm of religious practice, the government certainly DOES force many citizens and institutions to engage in acts that may violate their religious tenets.  For example, consider the debate about providing contraceptive coverage to employees.\\n\\n&gt;In other words, the government can force you to say \"Wash your Hands\" but can\\'t force you to worship an idol.\\n\\nFirst, the government actually cannot and does not force you to say \"wash your hands\" in any context.  Second, the government certainly does force you to do things that some would classify as idol worship in their religious interpretations, for example, paying taxes (worshiping money or submitting to a secular god).\\n\\nSecond, my point is NOT that ANY restrictions on speech is impermissible.  Speech restrictions are put in place by the government all the time.  Similar restrictions are also put in place for religious practices.  \\n\\nBut it is an entirely uninformed and gross misconception of the relevant constitutional provisions to not classify the act of speaking certain gender pronouns AS speech that WOULD fall under the rubric of first amendment protections. \\n\\nIt clearly does, and then the courts would have to do an analysis of whether those restrictions are permissible under the first amendment.\\n\\nTo be fair, one way that the courts might permit such restrictions might be based on a finding that the government has a compelling interest in protecting the health well being of transgendered individuals such that an onerous restriction on speech is justified.\\n\\nBut this is not a given, and the courts would also have to weigh all the countervailing harms about restrictions on speech.  \\n\\nBut most importantly, and this is the critical part that you\\'re missing because you clearly have NO background in first amendment jurisprudence, the type of speech of saying certain pronouns would be a highly protected form of speech such that a content specific restriction on it would face an EXTREMELY high hurdle to clear constitutional review.\\n\\nEDIT:  if you don\\'t trust what I\\'ve just said about first amendment law, you should share what I said with a friend who actually did go to law school and took first amendment law to help you assess this.  This is a technical issue and not something that you\\'ll just be able to \"intuit\" and \"argue with\" without any familiarity with the legal literature.\\n\\n'\n",

Telling a judge that \"paying taxes (worshiping money or submitting to a secular god)\" is a pretty good way to get your sentence increased when you get convicted of tax fraud.\\n\\nAnyways, the law can and does absolutely require people in different professions to say things as part of their labor.  Sometimes this is even used for political means, such as forcing medical professionals to not discuss abortions or forcing them to provide information on adoption.\\n\\nRefusing to do so doesn\\'t mean a person ends up in prison, it just means that they can\\'t participate in that economic activity.  So yes, Free Speech lets you call them whatever pronoun you want in the store without committing a crime, but it may subsequently make any economic activity you do with them illegal.\\n\\nAnyways, the greatest evidence that my position is correct is that it is currently the law both de jure and de facto.'\n",

And Rousey was basically a built up storyline of this super dominant fighter, when in reality she took advantage of a grass roots division with zero talent. \\n\\nBut the reality is the women's card piggybacks on the men's. They fight on the same card, so as a viewer, you're not going to turn it off when the female fight is up, because it's right there. However, that same viewer may not go out of their way to SEEK out an all female card. The same thing happens in tennis where women's numbers get inflated due to occurring at the same time as men's.

It’s not because they are women, it’s because they would be unknown fighters with questionable skills.  That part is mostly a numbers thing. There are probably 10x as many male fighters. The point being that the audience first values the brand (UFC), then the fighters regardless of gender. This generally means being female isn’t a hindrance across the board or that male sports are inherently preferred across the board.\\n\\nSecond, we have recognized female sports generally get lower numbers. The question is whether that is intrinsic or extrinsic. When you look at many sports where money and promotion is not a huge factor, viewership is low, but often comparable or skewed towards women (eg. Most Olympic events, minor league sports, etc.). In fact, I’d say gender and skill differences correlating to audience size is false. In fact, the major sports where you see large differences are the exceptions. Do you really think that many more people watch college baseball than college softball? \\n\\nSo I think we are inventing desire, and conditioning the audience to value men’s professional sports more.

Often the very pinnacle of college players are better than G league players, and basketball is a very individually driven sport, so this argument holds no weight. The same reason people watched lebron in highschool (POTENTIAL is a thing ya know). You keep bringing up these oddities that have pretty easy to see explanations. Just an ignorant example. It is difficult to argue with someone who is going to obtusely ignore the context surrounding exceptions to the rule.\\n\\nSomething like women's tennis finals outdoing the men's could be due to several factors, such as where the event was held (hometown favorite). Nationality of the players in the finals (tennis popularity varies by region). I'm not saying women's sport is doomed to non-existence, nor that factors can't RARELY vault it above the men's in terms of viewership. However, these instances require large amounts of extraneous circumstance to occur, and will never be the norm. \\n\\nLet's face it, if you have a race and one group is running 9.5 and the other is running 10+, unless there is extra incentive to watch the 10+ (ex. national star) then everyone is going to watch the 9.5 race.   TLDR: there are definitely multiple factors that generate views and interest, however skill level is BY FAR the largest (imo). I'm honestly not even sure what your argument is at this point. If it's that there are multiple factors that affect viewership: I don't even disagree. \"\n",
      " 'You, once again are missing the point. Yes, the best athletes tend to belong to leagues who spend millions of dollars advertising that fact, which in turn gets more viewers. The point is the feedback loop isn’t something intrinsic to any league nor is it necessarily related to relative athletic skill. \\n\\nI’m not saying the skill of the team or athletes doesn’t matter, I am saying it is but one factor among many. For example, does NFL tv viewership correspond to the strength of the team? No, not [really](http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/whos-americas-nfl-team-nielsens-media-exposure-rankings-detail-the-top-franchise.html).  As you can see the Cowboys had more viewership despite being one of the worst teams that year. As noted in the article:\\n\\n&gt; Winning records didn’t necessarily correlate to higher indices. In fact, four out of the top 10 teams in the Exposure Ranking analysis didn’t even make the playoffs last season. The Super Bowl champion Denver Broncos, bolstered by top 10 finishes in all categories, were able to crack the top five, while reigning MVP Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers finished eighth overall.\\n\\nThat’s within a given sport, but even between sports, leagues, and levels of play, you can see this.  As has been noted, the best women’s athletes in many sports couldn’t beat a skilled male high school age player or team. Do you think the average fan would rather watch the 100th ranked male tennis player play the 80th ranked male tennis player, or watch Serena Williams play? We both acknowledge that either player could almost certainly beat  Serena without issue. Why would people watch worse tennis in your opinion?  Could it be that maybe absolute skill isn’t as big a factor as you think it is? Could it be that the appeal of watching Serena is partly based on how we’ve gotten to know her, and how we’ve become habituated to watching her play. We’ve been sold that product. The issue is that we rarely push hard to see other female athletes the way we do male athletes. \\n\\nNow I have no doubt you could come up with a likely supposition to explain away any example I give. The point is that there are so many counter examples it invalidates the rule. Whether is male vs. female gymnastics, little league baseball vs. college baseball, or even college baseball vs. single A baseball. The correlation you asset really doesn’t hold in any meaningful way. \\n\\nWhich brings me back to the original point. We invent desire for things that distorts it’s intrinsic value. We can see that men’s sports are typically watched by more people. What we don’t see is whether that reality was primarily created by audience demand and preferences, or by the fact that there are entire industries created to convince you to value it more than women’s sports. ESPN convinced millions of people to watch people play poker, and to watch kids spell words. Marketing matters A LOT.\\n\\nTo analogize, do the best tv shows have the biggest audience? What about movies? Yes quality matters, but the market largely is what it is because of the way the product is sold.  That’s one reason why producers often spend almost as much marketing a movie as they did producing it. ']\n",

But non-traditional gender identities are not a thing in most of Europe.  I've never heard any Belgian make a serious claim that they're not male nor female.  Nor do I think that should happen in Belgium. And I also don't think we need to accept them.  \\n\\nThere is as far as I know not a single piece of proper, peer-reviewed biology-based scientific study out there that suggests that there are more genders than male and female.  Heck it's literally coded in our DNA.  Males have XY-chromosomes, Females have XX-chromosomes.  Before you bring it up: yes I'm aware that some people with XY-chromosomes physically manifest as females.  This is a genetic disorder. \\n\\nWhat does happen here in Belgium is trans people.  And I'm fine with those as long as you want to be the other gender not some made up one.  And I'll refer to you with the pronoun of the gender you chose to be if you look like that gender.  But you can't just say today I'm a female tomorrow I'm a man and the day after tomorrow I'm some made up gender.  It just doesn't work that way in biology.\"\n",

For example there are people with female reproductive parts that have XY chromosomes. \"\n",
      " \"You linked me a bunch of podcasts.  Not scientific, biology-based, peer-reviewed studies.\\n\\nYes indeed in a very limited amount of people you have more than XX or XY.

If there is a Y in there it's likely, but not guaranteed, that you present as male.  But that Y can have mutations on it causing the person who has it to present as female even though they have an XY (more specifically if the [SRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testis-determining_factor) has a mutation in it).   Except for XY and XX it's very likely that there is a physical appearance that you have some kind of genetic disorder.\\n\\nTo empathize it again this is a very very limited amount of people.

The law in no way shape or form acknowledges non-traditional genders.  \\n\\nAnd you still can't just say today I'm male tomorrow I'm female.  You have to make a written request detailing why you want to change gender from male to female or female to male that will be send to the public prosecutor.

If no negative advice is given the person should after those 3 months but within 6 months of the original request make a written statement saying he/she is aware of the legal and administrative consequences.

      "[\"Im not going to argue that Islam is good. Im trying to build doubt in you that its entirety of the religion thats bad instead of a particular ideology within the beliefsystem of islam. \\n\\nIf you dont feel like reading my opinion at least read the [speech](http://www.friedenspreis-des-deutschen-buchhandels.de/445651/?mid=1042759)  \\nas it gives some more insight in the topic.\\n\\n\\n&gt;&gt;I also will reject any arguments to the true meaning of the Quran or misunderstanding/mistranslations\\n\\nSo you hold a belief, and not an opinion on matters concering the true meaning of the Quran? If not you should feel free to accept the premise that there might be different interpretations of the same text. \\n\\n&gt;&gt;If many people misunderstand the teachings of the Quran, then Islam is at fault because the actions are what matters.\\n\\nTo reiterate upon this point: christians thought it was okay that the Bible was written in Latin and could only be read by priests for about 1500 years. \\nWere they wrong? Maybe. From our prespective: yes sure. We all should be able to read it and form our ideas from it. This does mean that those people how tought religious ideology and faith at that time wanted people to live in a particular way. Not that it is a necessity the religion expects.\\n\\nTo make the case that this is also valid in Islam I'm going to quote from a speech of a Irani German intellectual, Navid Kermani who studied orientology in Kairo. Its worth reading the entire [speech](http://www.friedenspreis-des-deutschen-buchhandels.de/445651/?mid=1042759) but it has a different main theme. (emphasis mine)\\n\\n&gt;Let me illustrate the loss of creativity and freedom in the context of my own field: there was a time when it was conceivable, and even taken for granted, that the Quran is a poetic text which can only be grasped using the tools and methods of literary studies, no differently than a poem.\\n\\nso there might be reason to agree with my premise from above.\\n\\n&gt;It was conceivable and taken for granted that a theologian was at the same time a literary scholar and an expert on poetry, and in many cases a poet himself. \\n\\nThe Quran ought to have another meaning. \\n\\n&gt;In our time, my own teacher Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd in Cairo was charged with heresy, [...] because he conceived Quranic studies as a form of literary scholarship. In other words, an approach to the Quran which was once taken for granted, and for which Nasr Abu Zayd was able to cite the **most important scholars of classical Islamic theology**, is no longer even acknowledged as thinkable. \\n\\nThe problem with current islam is the people who are teaching it.\\nAnd with those who dont feel the need to openly oppose them and combat the detrumental and dangerous ideology of current whahabi islam.\\n\\n\\n&gt;&gt;Causation matters! This is a big one for me and is probably the part I'm least sure about, so be sure to think about it. I'm willing to accept that Islam is not to blame if it can be shown that the problems I have happen independent of religion.\\n\\nWell yes and no. People, as said before, interpret things differently and the lack of action by many people in the past century lead to what we face now.  \\nIn the past people used Islam as a basis for cultural rutuals and combined there regional culture with that of Islam. This is what gave us\\n\\n&gt;writings of the mystics, philosophers, rhetoricians and theologians. [...] the intellectual scope, the aesthetic power and the great humanity we find in the spirituality of Ibn Arabi, the poetry of Rumi, the historiography of Ibn Khaldun, the poetic theology of Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani, the philosophy of Averroes, the travel reports of Ibn Battuta; and in the tales of the Thousand and One Nights, which are worldly – yes, worldly and erotic, and feminist too, incidentally, and at the same time infused with the spirit and the verses of the Quran on every page.  \\n\\nThe Quran and Islam with it wasn't only used for evil. It did work. But right now.\\n\\n&gt; None of this can be found in the religious culture of modern Islam, nothing whatsoever that is even remotely comparable, that is as fascinating, as profound as the writings I came across as a student. To say nothing of Islamic architecture, Islamic art or Islamic musicology: they no longer exist.\\n\\nThe question is now: makes this change Islam intrinsically bad? \\n\\nI don't think so.\\n\\nThe main problem that we face with Islam is not that it is intrinsically bad but that there are main stream ideologies floating around which don't permit any muslim to question their teachings, which dont permit muslims to interpret their religion how they want. Which don't permit muslims to critizise any part of islam. \\n\\n&gt; The love of one’s own – one’s own culture, one’s own country and also one’s own person – manifests itself in self-criticism. \\n\\nAnd right now we are missing self-criticism or rather we are missing a state where self-criticism is permitted without certain death in some muslim countries because those ideologies had way too long time to spead in those countries.\\n\\nAnd these thoughts and this ideology is speading towards us, which is the reason you are aware of its existence.\\nThey are attractive to young people in europe for various reasons you can firgure out for yourself. And many people will see different reasons, and many people will disagree with everything that can be said over why it is attractive to young people in the west.\\n\\nStill this ideology is the opposite of what Islam was prior to the establishment of radical rules.\\n\\n&gt; we also know it is not just in Iraq and Syria that the world is strictly divided into what is forbidden and what is permitted – and humanity divided into believers and unbelievers.\\n\\nBut all over the islamic world. \\n\\n&gt;A school of thought that declares all people of other religions heretics, and berates, terrorises, vilifies and insults them, has been promulgated for decades, sponsored with billions from oil production, in mosques, in books and on television. If you denigrate other people systematically, day after day, it is only logical – how well we know this from our own history, from German history – that you will end up declaring their lives worthless. That such a religious fascism has become conceivable at all, that IS is able to recruit so many fighters, and still more sympathisers, that it has been able to overrun entire countries and capture major cities with hardly a fight – this is not the beginning, but rather the endpoint to date of a long decline, and I am referring not least to the decline of religious thought.\\n\\nThis is the main argument. They despise religion. Those fundamentalist fascist despise the icons of their own religion. Their hatred for everything that does not confirm their narrow belief is beyond comprehension.\\n\\n&gt;One might have thought that the religious fundamentalists [...] would have valued at least their own culture. Yet the opposite was the case: by seeking to return to a supposed point of origin, **they not only neglected Islamic tradition, but resolutely fought** it. We are only surprised by Islamic State’s acts of iconoclasm because we never noticed that there are virtually no ancient relics left in Saudi Arabia. In Mecca, the Wahhabis have destroyed the tombs and mosques of the Prophet’s closest kin, including the house he was born in. The historic mosque of the Prophet in Medina has been replaced with a colossal new building, and on the site where, until a few years ago, the house of Muhammad and his wife Khadija stood, there is now a public toilet.\\n\\nIslamic culture has imploded and we are witnessing the end right now. If you think that those, who are alienate their own religion so far from its culture are the true representatives for it, you may keep your view. If however you see that there are more than one ideologies who disguise themselves under then name of islam while fighting the centuries old core of islam you should see that we are not seeing islam as the worst religon right now. We are seeing a perverted mixture of hatred filled facist ideology mixed with a fundamental religious ideology. And we are seeing how Islam is fighting it. \\n\\nWe are seeing how Islam is attacked by this perverse mixture that will use violence against everyone because they see their lives as worthless.  \\nWe are seeing how people are trying to fight this ideology, in the name of Islam.   \\nWe are maybe witnessing the end of Islam how we should know it.  \\nAnd how our children and grandchildren will know it.  \\nWe are witnessing the destruction of a centuries old faith for one reason alone.\\n\\nMay the power of love be greater than the power of hatred.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n",

Your good intention is there, but limited to only not want to cause distress, instead of actually acknowledging their identity. I might misinterpret your intentions though. Thats why i have to ask.\\n\\nAs for the rest: I'm trans myself, so my view might not be the unbiased. If thats a problem for you, just dismiss it.\\n \\nDysphoria is explained as the distress someone feels with the gender/sex they were assigned at birth. For a easier understanding, Dysphoria as a word simply means the opposite of Euphoria (if you didn't know this).\\n\\nI left out gender identity in this explanation, because its important to know that gender/sex dysphoria can happen without identity playing a role in it. For example, there are lots of cis women who are distressed about their bodies gendered/sexed parts out of countless reasons (pmdd very often lead to lots of dysphoria). Same goes for gender roles. They can cause dysphoria for whatever reason. Note, that a simple dislike is not dysphoria. Pathologically its important, that to be counted as dysphoria, it has to have an serious impact on someones life. Many women ARE distressed about the role forced onto them from society (and that IS indeed a form of gender dysphoria). I have to say that there are also cis men who are deeply distressed about their bodies or roles. In my experience it just so happens to be more prevalent with women.\\n\\nThose things don't make those cis people trans though. This is where identity comes into play. Gender Identity is a completely seperated concept, that is intertwined with sex, gender roles and gender presentation, but its important to not conflate those if we dicsuss it. Its the hardest part to grasp for most people, because it sounds wishy washy and not very sciency, but to the surprise of many, most recent studies point to a biological explanation (i can provide more info here, but since it isn't really important to the discussion i let my lazyness take the best part of me, and just wait to provide links until you explicitily ask for it).\\n\\nAn easy explanation for gender identity is simple: Its how you perceive your own gender (regardless of roles, presentation or sex). There really isn't more to it. It is more innate then gender roles you would like to conform to, so just seeing yourself as feminine isn't enough. And its not really how you want to dress (though how you want to be perceived based on your identity is important to most trans people, mostly out of practical reasons). It simply is as said: How you see yourself. And the mismatch between their identity and their assigned sex at birth is what makes a trans person trans (see, this even leaves place for non binary identities).\\n\\nMany cis people conflate their gender identity with their sex (as you did). That is ok though for normal life interactions, because for the most part, it is true, male = man and female = woman (but important as said to seperate it in discussions like this). Its hard to describe to someone like you, how a mismatch of your identity and your sex feels like. Because they really have a blind spot in their own perception for it. Imagine describing colors to a blind person. Its almost impossible. The same happens with gender identity.\\n\\nI can tell you, that i myself don't see myself as anything else than a women. A woman that has a huge birth defect, and this sucks, but im a woman nontheless. I cannot explain to you, why i do not associate with my birth sex, and believe me, i would give a lot to be able to do so. But as it happens, im unable to (and i tried for 33 years).\\n\\nSo why do i explain all of this: Simply because the mismatch of ones gender identity and birth sex CAN and most of the time ARE the cause for gender dysphoria (be it dysphoria about your own body or the gender role you have to play and yes, even the clothes you are forced to wear). And in most cases it does, and can be very traumatic to many trans people.\\n\\nIn my experience though, the mismatch only very rarely do NOT cause dysphoria. In most cases were people claimed to have no dysphoria, it was mostly a semantics problem, repression of ones issues, inexperience or even ignorance (yeah, even trans people can be ignorant about their own condition). BUT theoretically it could be possible. There could be people that do not suffer from gender dysphoria. Though i think if that is true, why would they even have an incentive to transition anyway. Most people claiming to have no dyphoria i know say they are simply happier and call this gender euporia instead of gender dysphoria, but since both are the two sides of the same coin, it is actually the same concept, and therefor it shouldn't matter what you call it. The mismatch in your gender identity gave you simply a incentive to transition. That is why i would say, some form of dysphoria is prevalent in every trans person.\\n\\nAnd if you can follow my explanation and agree, you can see, that your CMV kinda becomes baseless.\"\n",
      " 'I have to disagree with you here, I find that OP is actually separating sex and gender quite clearly.\\n\\nOP might correct me if I\\'m wrong, but I think his opinion is as follow:\\nIf you have sex dysphoria, it\\'s normal and considered for others to use your preferred pronoun because it would be rude to remind you you have a body that doesn\\'t match your mental state.\\nHis problem arise with people who say \"I have a male/female body, I\\'m comfortable with it, but since I mostly like to do stuff women/men usually do, I\\'m transgender.\" His argument is that by labeling/continue to label certain activities as for men or for women, these people are not fighting gender roles but abiding to them. Fighting gender roles would be doing things because you want, not to follow or go against what the gender commonly associated with your sex tells you to do.'\n",
      " 'The mismatch between birth sex and gender identity is what causes dysphoria (and not the other way around). Having a different gender identity to your birth sex makes you trans. Dysphoria is not the the supposition to being trans (as shown above, even cis people can have gender dysphoria). So even if i personally think, most (if not all) trans people have some form of dysphoria, we shouldn\\'t conflate both things.\\n\\nAnd if you can accept those things, you might see that this CMV is pointless because it operates on the notion that dysphoria is needed to be trans.\\n\\n&gt; \"I have a male/female body, I\\'m comfortable with it, but since I mostly like to do stuff women/men usually do, I\\'m transgender.\"\\n\\nCan you see how this sentence is problematic then? No trans person i ever knew would say something like that. Questioning trans people often ask similar question, but the intention is different. I read a variation of \"i do this and this and that, could this be a indication to me being trans?\". They do not conflate gender roles with gender identity, instead they ask for confirmation of their own identity (replace trans in the question with either gender). No trans person is trans because they are feminine/masculine. Trans people are trans because they have a mismatch on how they see themselves with what has been assigned to them at birth.']\n",

For instance, scientists may make hypotheses about the world, but unlike religious individuals, they actually develop falsifiable claims that they can test through empirical experiments. For example, if a scientist wants to test which brand of dog food leads to the most weight gain in dogs, they will randomly sample a large amount of dog food brands, give each of them to randomly assigned groups of dogs, and record the weight gains in each of these groups in order to test said claims. Religious individuals, on the other side of the spectrum, do not create falsifiable, testable claims, rather, they adhere to a piece of dogma that have been taught to them, and put all their faith in the dogma\\'s truth instead of empirically testing it, challenging it, questioning it, or reasoning with it.

A secular country, especially the USA, does not rely on RELIGION to dictate morality, rather, LAW, two completely different and separate entities. RELIGION is a belief/faith that individuals have that provides them with 1. A metaphysical reality about their world and 2. A set of ethics/morals to live by to provide themselves with significance, whereas a LAW is a socially agreed upon standard that all citizens of a country adhere to in order to regulate their actions and enforce penalties if said standards are violated. \\n\\nI would also like to read some research that you cited about how exactly poor education and atheism leads to elevated crime rates because I have yet to read any research that proves this claim. \\n\\nThe second section of your attempt to \"change my view\" is just a personal attack and an assumption about my characters/beliefs, so I do not think it is necessary to address it.']\n",

The point is the number of people who are actual white supremacists in the US is tiny and anti-fa is not solely targetting that probably group of 100k or less people.']\n",

      "If this data shows that blacks are being discriminated against because they receive fewer call backs, then it also shows an alarming trend of Brad supremacy. Todd, Neal, and Geoffrey received nearly half of the number of callbacks as Brad. Clearly, the Todd's, Neal's, and Geoffrey's of a single city in the US are also being discriminated against. Right? It also shows that potential employers prefer the black names Leroy and Jermain at nearly 60% higher rates than the names Todd and Neal. Why do employers hate Todd's and Neal's so much? \n",

      "If the deciding factor of calling back a potential employee was their name, white and black names would have a much smaller variance for their callback rates. The fact that Todd's are three times less likely to receive a callback than Brad's shows that there is something else influencing their decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "The motives of a group who would put forth the conclusions of a study with such large disparities between the control groups should be called into question.

      "\n",
      "&gt;The patterns in the data appear most consistent with a model in which the rise of the Black Power movement influenced how Blacks perceived their identities. Among Blacks born in the last two decades, names provide a strong signal of socioeconomic status, which was not previously the case. We find, however, no negative relationship between having a distinctively Black name and later life outcomes after controlling for a child’s circumstances at birth.\n",

      "\n",
      "Blacks at 25-35%, whites at 10-18%, in general, per state.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why bring all this up when it all seems to point that the fact that the U.S. has a race problem? Because when I think \"racial tension\" I think civil rights and government. If only the problem were as easy as changing the laws (and I do think some laws, like drug law, disproportionately affects black communities.) A lot of Chinese I know like to say there's \"no racism in China\" which I think is very similar to what one of Iran's leaders said, \"we don't have any gays in Iran.\" You could accuse me of saying something similar here. Which is to say you could say I'm just using a different way of defining \"racial tension\" that misdirects you from an issue. For example, China's being xenophobic and ignorant toward other cultures/races (not to mention that for all intents and purposes China is like 90% Han Chinese and nearly 99.9% Chinese overall, and their history of cultural domination, Tibet, etc.); or Iran's execution of some gays and that their gays are actually just incredibly in the closet as a result; or the United States's problem at the intersection of [poverty and race [1]](http://federalsafetynet.com/uploads/2/8/4/4/2844290/1442587447.jpg). [[2]](http://federalsafetynet.com/us-poverty-statistics.html).\n",
      "\n",
      "But I'm not doing that. Or, I'm not doing it intentionally. I think that labeling it as \"a race problem\" is perhaps not only incorrect, but it tends to make people reach into the \"civil rights law toolbox.\" A toolbox which I don't think contains the remedy we need.\n",
      "\n",
      "The problem is culture. This means white american culture, black american culture, and the general overculture of the United States that binds us together as a country -- the values and attitudes we all hold, black or white, that make us American despite our differences. I can't tell you what this solution is but we've made great and relatively exceptional pace towards that goal. My hunch is that until we hit a post-scarcity civilization we're going to be dealing with this \"race problem.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "What this means, unfortunately I think, is related to stats like how in Mississipi only 18% of businesses are owned by blacks despite the state being 37% black in terms of population. The question is, do you want a country that mandates by law that if X% of the population is Y (Race, sex, age, intelligence) then X% of businesses must be owned by Y? I don't. And America is very much not that country. It could change, yes, but it's an unrealistic hope even in the long term.\n",
      "\n",
      "This means we go about it by attacking symptoms. We provide things like basic income. We provide things like SNAP. And most importantly of all we provide education. *To everyone.* But all of that is meaningless unless there is a movement within the black community to (and I rightly dislike this idiom) pull oneself up by one's bootstraps. But it seems to me that it's an accurate summation of the situation. The phrase points to an extreme difficulty, if not outright impossibility to the point of it being almost ridiculous. [Crab mentality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crab_mentality), victim mentality, anti-intellectualism. All three seem to be deeply suffused into black culture, and perhaps even rightly so. After all, historically they were victims of slavery, forced sterilization, etc. It's not surprising. \n",
      "\n",
      "But imagine you're a black kid who grows up in poverty. You grow up learning that you have no chance, that the system is out to get you, that had you been born not more than near 150 years ago and you'd be a slave or 50 years ago and you wouldn't be able to vote. You learn this from personal experience and you learn it from your friends and family and school. Then your role models are engaged in crime and general non-conforming ways of making a living because stealing from the people fucking you doesn't seem all that bad in your moral calculation (who doesn't think Aladdin was justified in stealing the bread?). So you grow to be just like them. Cycle of poverty. Cycle of crime.\n",
      "\n",
      "How to stop it? As leaders or as citizens, how do we stop it? The answer I propose is *we can't.* Despite what we believe, namely that we're all one species and we all have equal right to live and be happy, if you and me go there and try to make change we'll be rejected and even if we aren't we wont be the solution. Black kids need black role models. They need someone to look up to with reasonable and attainable goals. The black community needs to save itself. It must assert itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "This isn't the happy solution. And it might even strengthen the racial divides -- the ones that seem to organically appear as people \"ghettoize\" themselves or are ghettoized by things like \"white flight.\" But good fucking luck telling that black kid in urban poverty that he should look up to a successful white businessman or successful white scientist, and that it shouldn't matter that he's white and not black. 'aint gonna work. Interestingly, this is what affirmative action is supposed to be -- a way for government to intervene and try to change society to repair the historical disadvantage. In 2003 Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Conner said, \"We expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.\" We're 13 years away from that day. I hope she's right, but I really doubt it. Both because affirmative action's (race-based government intervention to change culture/society) effectiveness is in much dispute, and because I think these problems stem from our tribalistic nature.\n",

      "I think this view is very typical of those on the outside looking in. For some reason people will believe that only overt racism is racism, which in this would be your view that racial tension equals that which can be solved by civil rights legislation, which is only the tip of the ice berg when it comes to racism. This totally ignores the subtle and insidious racism that permeates American culture. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second tactic is to divorce race from the conversation by labeling this a class issue. The problem is that historically race has been what drives class. They were poor because they are black. I've always found it interesting that people will willingly concede that that blacks are disproportionately more likely to be poor,  but then at the same time believe it isn't a race issue. That is some serious cognitive dissonance.  Just to make a extreme analogy to drive my point home,  it would be like if I said Jews were disproportionately more likely to be killed by nazis, but the jews weren't killed because of their ethnicity/religion. Have you ever asked yourself why blacks are disproportionately  more likely to be poor? Have you ever asked yourself why blacks weren't able to pass down wealth at the rates whites were? It's not like blacks had no idea what assets or inheritance were.  Basically all of this leads all leads to somewhere.  If we go back to my Jewish analogy there was a glaring question left unanswered. Maybe there are other reasons for the phenomenon that isn't racism. That's the way this argument is set up. I dont even have to read your full post to know you spoke about culture, and bonus points if you used the phrase boot straps. I know this without reading because this argument is fairly common among racists and non racists alike.  This isn't a white thing either,  as you will find people of all races including black people make this argument.  The common dominator here is lack of a quality education about blacks in America,  which isn't uncommon due to the fact that we only teach it one month a year and we barely cover anything outside of mlk and the naacp. Because of this people will make the bootstraps argument without realizing the long history of blacks trying to do that very thing. From 40 acres and a mule, to w.e.b. Dubois, to George Washington carver, to black wall street, to Marcus Garvey, to the nation of islam, and to the nation of islam. All of these people/groups/programs we're about securing assets and creating self sustaining African American communities, and all of them were assassinated, discredited, and in the case of 40 acres and a mule, an outright lie. So many times throughout history, blacks have tried to sustain them selves and white America responded with incredulity, smear campaigns, the rope, and the gun. So the cultural argument is not only tone deaf, but one that is almost entirely based on ignorance. It's respectability politics in its worst form.  \n",
      "\n",
      "There are other problems with this argument that I don't want to get into too much. The first is that we never examine the fact that we live in a culture that promotes white supremacy,  and is permeated with racist beliefs, colloquial phrases,  and stereotypes. It's also interesting that few people ever examine how black culture came to be what it is.  It's almost like they believe it came about totally in a vacuum with no outside influence. Anyway /rant lol and forgive the typos because I don't feel like proof reading this.\n",

      "Great! How you measure harm and good are going to matter, but for simplicity let's say things like income  are fairly accurate measures of well being. So there are two questions we have to answer.\n",
      "\n",
      "1) What is the well being of a child adopted into a different race and country?\n",
      "\n",
      "2) What would have been the well being of that child if he/she hadn't been adopted?\n",
      "\n",
      "Both of these things are going to exist on a distribution. Some kids get adopted by the best parents in the world, some get adopted by complete monsters, but the averages here are probably what you're most interested in. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll do a quick calculation that will give a general idea, but is not going to be super accurate. I'm going to talk about America, because that's were I am, but the same process could be done anywhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a measure of well being let's take GDP per capita, but to know how well off the child would have been had they not been adopted we need to know the country of origin, because well being differs a lot from country to country. According to the [State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/aa/pdfs/2015Annual_Intercountry_Adoption_Report.pdf) the majority of cross national adoptions come from China. We'll use the [CIA World Fact Book](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html) for GDP. So the US has a GDP per capita of 53,100 dollars while China has a GDP per capita of 14,300. So by this measure, on average people in the US are a lot better off than people in China. Now the adopted child will suffer from the psychological harm you point out in your OP. We don't know how to monetize it, but we can answer the question, how bad would it have to be for the child to prefer staying in China. As long as the psychological harm from being adopted is worth less than 38,200 dollars a year the child would prefer being adopted. That's a lot of money so I would suspect on average children adopted to America are better off than those that stay in China. \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me restate this is suggestive evidence rather than conclusive proof, but I would guess for the average case adopting from a different country is probably a pretty ethical decision. \n",

      "your question now says \"non-support\" for nato/eu, and I think it previously said some negative adjective, I was really high so I could be remembering it wrong, I'll give you that. I did a bit of research and you are right about illegal immigration somewhat stabilizing, but he still didn't eliminate the problem. http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan/full this says it will cut taxes for everyone. DeVos, upon further research, actually is qualified; she started the American Federation for Children in 2010 and for close to 30 years she has been a known advocate of legislation that benefits schools and the kids in them. Trump (probably) doesn't have an answer to it now as it isn't a problem now\n",

      "Even if we say DeVos is minimally qualified I would say there must be 100 or so people more qualified than her and who support the same policies. Either way most of my arguments hold, particularly in the case of EU/NATO (My post always said non-support btw! But no bad, it was productive to talk about it). On wealth inequality your paper also mentions that while everyone will get a tax break most of it will go for the upper range of incomes, so wealth inequality still goes up.

      "&gt;Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an anxiety disorder that causes a person to have a distorted view of how they look and to spend a lot of time worrying about their appearance. For example, they may be convinced that a barely visible scar is a major flaw that everyone is staring at, or that their nose looks abnormal.\n",

      "An anorexic person is someone who believes they are fat. They may be fat at first, but over time as they become skinnier and skinnier they continue to believe they are fat, often to a point where it harms their physical health when they continue to starve themselves in order to become skinnier when they are already underweight.\n",

If a transgender person starts hormones... after a while they no longer fixate as much on their appearance.

      "Finally, there is a reason that traditional treatments like cognitive behavioral therapy and treatment through anti-psychotics/anti-depressents works for anorexia and does not work for gender dysphoria *at all*, and that's because anorexia is a software issue and gender dysphoria is a hardware issue. Gender dysphoria is a matter of hard-wired orientation. It's no more fixable than homosexuality.\n",

      "While it's common for individuals in the trans community to become body dysmorphic over features that they perceive as making them look like the wrong sex (such as a transgender woman becoming obsessed with the size of her forehead even after facial feminization surgery), transgender people typically do not continue to struggle with their bodies after they've fixed their bodies enough to be passable members of the sex they are trying to live as. Most of the trans people I know really struggle for the first year to two years and when they start to hit that point where they are passing I watch as these people very visibly calm the fuck down and move on with their lives. Transition. Fucking. Works.\n",

      "Well if I look at it from a scientific perspective, being transgender is not a mental disorder. This has been the conclusion of every major psychological organization. Your claim that it is indisputably a mental disorder is false. If you look at the opinions of experts who actually study transgender health, almost none of them consider it to be a mental disorder. The claim that being transgender is a mental disorder is psuedoscience.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the APA:\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;A psychological state is considered a mental disorder only if it causes significant distress or disability. Many transgender people do not experience their gender as distressing or disabling, which implies that identifying as transgender does not constitute a mental disorder. For these individuals, the significant problem is finding affordable resources, such as counseling, hormone therapy, medical procedures and the social support necessary to freely express their gender identity and minimize discrimination. Many other obstacles may lead to distress, including a lack of acceptance within society, direct or indirect experiences with discrimination, or assault. These experiences may lead many transgender people to suffer with anxiety, depression or related disorders at higher rates than nontransgender persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "&gt;According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders(DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of \"gender dysphoria.\" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care. The International Classification of Diseases(ICD) is under revision and there may be changes to its current classification of intense persistent gender incongruence as \"gender identity disorder.\"\n",

Who want more women in STEM, who want to break down some preconceptions about gender, who want more female judges (because 50% of the law students are female after all), who want more female representatives. These real feminists have a worthy cause. A cause you and I can rally behind.\n",
      "The second group aim for inequality in favor for woman. This is a ridiculous small group, but a confirmation bias on Reddit makes this group seem huge. This very small group, is the group that we on Reddit love to get angry about. We do this, because calling an extremist not an extremist, is a way to discredit the whole group. \n",

If a \"non-feminist by definition\" can claim to be a \"feminist\" - and be called one - and represent \"feminist ideas\" to other people, then what is a feminist? Feminism should be what the definition says it is, but it is often not.\n",

It states that the law being changed will no longer require you to be sterilized or have transformative surgery to have your gender changed from male to female or female to male on your ID-card. This because it was apparently in violation of the European human rights treaty.  Not because people want to identify as neither male nor female.

You have to make a written request detailing why you want to change gender from male to female or female to male that will be send to the public prosecutor.  He has a maximum of 3 months to give a negative advice on this.  If no negative advice is given the person should after those 3 months but within 6 months of the original request make a written statement saying he/she is aware of the legal and administrative consequences.  Only then will you be seen as the other gender by the state.\n",

In case you're 16 you can go through the same procedure described above but you also have to have a written statement from a child-psychiatrist stating that you as a minor are capable of making that decision, know what its consequences are and aren't being pressured by anyone.  If you're younger than 12 you can't do anything to change your gender.\n",

      "Just out of curiosity: Does this mean you don't believe they are the gender they identify with, and only do so because you have been told it causes distress?\n",
      "\n",
      "If its the later, i find it a bit troubling. Your good intention is there, but limited to only not want to cause distress, instead of actually acknowledging their identity. I might misinterpret your intentions though. Thats why i have to ask.\n",

      "Dysphoria is explained as the distress someone feels with the gender/sex they were assigned at birth. For a easier understanding, Dysphoria as a word simply means the opposite of Euphoria (if you didn't know this).\n",
      "\n",
      "I left out gender identity in this explanation, because its important to know that gender/sex dysphoria can happen without identity playing a role in it. For example, there are lots of cis women who are distressed about their bodies gendered/sexed parts out of countless reasons (pmdd very often lead to lots of dysphoria). Same goes for gender roles. They can cause dysphoria for whatever reason. Note, that a simple dislike is not dysphoria. Pathologically its important, that to be counted as dysphoria, it has to have an serious impact on someones life. Many women ARE distressed about the role forced onto them from society (and that IS indeed a form of gender dysphoria). I have to say that there are also cis men who are deeply distressed about their bodies or roles. In my experience it just so happens to be more prevalent with women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those things don't make those cis people trans though. This is where identity comes into play. Gender Identity is a completely seperated concept, that is intertwined with sex, gender roles and gender presentation, but its important to not conflate those if we dicsuss it. Its the hardest part to grasp for most people, because it sounds wishy washy and not very sciency, but to the surprise of many, most recent studies point to a biological explanation (i can provide more info here, but since it isn't really important to the discussion i let my lazyness take the best part of me, and just wait to provide links until you explicitily ask for it).\n",
      "\n",
      "An easy explanation for gender identity is simple: Its how you perceive your own gender (regardless of roles, presentation or sex). There really isn't more to it. It is more innate then gender roles you would like to conform to, so just seeing yourself as feminine isn't enough. And its not really how you want to dress (though how you want to be perceived based on your identity is important to most trans people, mostly out of practical reasons). It simply is as said: How you see yourself. And the mismatch between their identity and their assigned sex at birth is what makes a trans person trans (see, this even leaves place for non binary identities).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many cis people conflate their gender identity with their sex (as you did). That is ok though for normal life interactions, because for the most part, it is true, male = man and female = woman (but important as said to seperate it in discussions like this). Its hard to describe to someone like you, how a mismatch of your identity and your sex feels like. Because they really have a blind spot in their own perception for it. Imagine describing colors to a blind person. Its almost impossible. The same happens with gender identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can tell you, that i myself don't see myself as anything else than a women. A woman that has a huge birth defect, and this sucks, but im a woman nontheless. I cannot explain to you, why i do not associate with my birth sex, and believe me, i would give a lot to be able to do so. But as it happens, im unable to (and i tried for 33 years).\n",
      "\n",
      "So why do i explain all of this: Simply because the mismatch of ones gender identity and birth sex CAN and most of the time ARE the cause for gender dysphoria (be it dysphoria about your own body or the gender role you have to play and yes, even the clothes you are forced to wear). And in most cases it does, and can be very traumatic to many trans people.\n",
      "\n",
      "In my experience though, the mismatch only very rarely do NOT cause dysphoria. In most cases were people claimed to have no dysphoria, it was mostly a semantics problem, repression of ones issues, inexperience or even ignorance (yeah, even trans people can be ignorant about their own condition). BUT theoretically it could be possible. There could be people that do not suffer from gender dysphoria. Though i think if that is true, why would they even have an incentive to transition anyway. Most people claiming to have no dyphoria i know say they are simply happier and call this gender euporia instead of gender dysphoria, but since both are the two sides of the same coin, it is actually the same concept, and therefor it shouldn't matter what you call it. The mismatch in your gender identity gave you simply a incentive to transition. That is why i would say, some form of dysphoria is prevalent in every trans person.\n",
      "\n",
      "And if you can follow my explanation and agree, you can see, that your CMV kinda becomes baseless.\n",

      "1, it's not *your* cake. It *society's* cake, it is available to you (or anyone else) only to the extent that society (via laws and via the courts) deems it to be available. This has always been the case, with gun rights as with all other rights.\n",
      "\n",
      "2, ALL of the laws referred to in this comic were passed by elected representatives of the people. Gun owners get to vote just like everyone else, and the people who win those elections pass laws. We call this representative democracy, and it's how the system works. These laws aren't benevolent compromises *given* by gun owners to non-gun-owners. They are laws, passed by the politicians *the people* (including many gun owners) elected. Don't like them? Vote for somebody else, or go live somewhere with a different system of government. \n",
      "\n",
      "3, These percentages are absurd. *Half* of all gun rights were eliminated by the *NFA*? Gun owners currently have like 1% of their rights remaining (at least according to this comic) yet still have the right in most states to own handguns, shotguns, muzzleloaders, bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles, right to open carry, right to concealed carry with a permit (in most places), etc. Amazing how gun owners gave up virtually all of their rights and yet still have the right to carry and use so many guns!\n",
      "\n",
      "4, Comparing eating cake to the gun debate is idiotic no matter which side you're on. Whether this is about rights or lives, I think we can ***all*** agree it's a bit more consequential on a national scale than whether or not someone gets to eat a whole cake. \n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: The \"cake\" isn't yours, you haven't \"given\" cake to anybody, the percentage of \"cake\" missing is ridiculous, and the entire idea of a \"cake\" analogy should be pretty offensive to both sides. \n",

How/why it begun is definitely a question that involves both scientific and religious components, but I do not believe that a God that created the great expansion of our universe would even bother to construct human beings (An insignificant species) in his vision and create an entire narrative with a storyline about sacrificing his son/a set of arbitrary rules for them to follow.

      "\n",
      "As for your first point regarding how \"the word of God\" does not answer all our questions in the same way that science does not answer all our questions, I believe that religion and science differ in these two regards. For instance, scientists may make hypotheses about the world, but unlike religious individuals, they actually develop falsifiable claims that they can test through empirical experiments. For example, if a scientist wants to test which brand of dog food leads to the most weight gain in dogs, they will randomly sample a large amount of dog food brands, give each of them to randomly assigned groups of dogs, and record the weight gains in each of these groups in order to test said claims. Religious individuals, on the other side of the spectrum, do not create falsifiable, testable claims, rather, they adhere to a piece of dogma that have been taught to them, and put all their faith in the dogma's truth instead of empirically testing it, challenging it, questioning it, or reasoning with it. Religion answers people's questions through blind faith, while science answers people's questions through empiricism and repeatable, falsifiable experimentation. \n",

      "Your second point about how religion is NOT just a schema human beings construct in order to comfort themselves of the inevitable meaninglessness and insignificance of their lives in comparison to the universe is also poor. \n",

      "Religion itself is not the moral guidebook individuals use in secular countries, they are laws the government create (Which dictate the separation between church and state) that ensures that citizens do not commit crimes, maintain their inalienable rights, and that the citizens/the government agree on a general set of ethics/morals. A secular country, especially the USA, does not rely on RELIGION to dictate morality, rather, LAW, two completely different and separate entities. RELIGION is a belief/faith that individuals have that provides them with 1. A metaphysical reality about their world and 2. A set of ethics/morals to live by to provide themselves with significance, whereas a LAW is a socially agreed upon standard that all citizens of a country adhere to in order to regulate their actions and enforce penalties if said standards are violated. \n",
